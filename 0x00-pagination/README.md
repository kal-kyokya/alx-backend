# 0x00. Pagination

This directory contains all files required for successful completion of the Pagination project by ALX Africa to its Software Engineering program during its Specialization segment.

## Requirements

	->	All files will be interpreted/compiled on:
			Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
				Using:
					python3 (version 3.7)
	->	All files should end with a new line
	->	The first line of all files should be exactly:
			#!/usr/bin/env python3
	->	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	->	All code should use:
			The pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
	->	All modules should have a documentation:
			python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
	->	All functions should have a documentation:
			python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
	->	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method.
	->	All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
